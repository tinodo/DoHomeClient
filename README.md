# DoHomeClient

This simple library allows you to communicate with your DoHome Smart Builbs.
The library is targeting devices with the old W600 chip and firmware 1.1.0
It should work with newer version as well.

Since the devices can only handle 1 concurrent TCP connection, you might not be able to use the mobile app at the same time as you use this library.
